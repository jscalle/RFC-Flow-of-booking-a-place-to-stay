**Abstract**

**Flow of the reservation of a place to stay**

The reservation process starts from the search section and/or list of results by default making a request for rooms according to their availability, according to the result of a query made to the available rooms the user makes the reservation according to their needs and requirements, within the options that can be seen the user will have different services that can be added to what you want to purchase in your reservation, the system will make different validations that will give the user the security that all the selected requirements are available and the necessary details, before the confirmation of the payment, the user must make a registration or a login to your account, this in order to have the basic data necessary to make the reservation, In addition to the other data possibly required, at the moment of login and confirmation, a &quot;provisional&quot; reservation of approximately 20 minutes will be made, which the user will have to make the necessary payments, upon receiving the payment confirmation the system will provide the user with an updated summary of the reservation, with the option to print or a QR for later reading and validation at the facilities, in addition an email will be sent after these 20 minutes if the system does not receive the payment confirmation from the user, the resources that had been previously selected will be made available again.

**Motivation**

**多Why do we do it?**

It is the specific process by which the whole reservation system takes coherence and/or sense, the user experience at this point is one of the issues that can help the service to be used and a reservation to be made.

**多What is the expected result?**

It is expected that the flow is the most appropriate and pleasant for a user who requires a reservation in a suitable place, it is necessary to previously have a good match in the consultation, but the flow that the user has is important for his experience.

**Detailed design**

Drawbacks

In general terms it should not be an option, it is necessary to have an adequate flow for the user experience to be adequate enough, the possible obstacles could be that the user understands that the flow is conditioned so that it is very likely that at the time of performing the process he will spend more money than he expects due to _upselling_ strategies that will be applied through the flow and different bonuses or add-ons that may be presented in the flow.

A second disadvantage would be to receive so many requests precisely because of the good flow that the reserve-provision query is saturated and does not work correctly.
